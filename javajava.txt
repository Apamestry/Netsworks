design an interface called vechicle
which include the following methods
1)void change gear(int a)
2)void speed up
3)void apply break(int x)
4)void start()
cREATE CLASSS CAR AND BIKE that implement the above methods ,crreate another c;lass  that called test vechicle
that includes the main method and 


craete an interface called plan having atttribute rate per unit.
Create a class electricity bill that attributr unit consumed.Let the class implemnt the interface plan and give value for rate per nunit,aslo create a method to compute the bill (units consumed* rate per unit)and display method .Create a seprate classs called test the above functionality
